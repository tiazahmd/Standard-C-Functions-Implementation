## Implementation of Standard C Library Fucntions
This is my take on implementing some standard C Library functions. So far, my implementations include the following functions:
- `strcat()`
- `strlen()`
- `strcpy()`
- `intcpy()` (This is my own function - integer copy. Using the same principles of `strcpy()`.)
